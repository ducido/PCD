## Introduction

> **Abstract** Generalist robot policies, or robotic foundation models, hold immense potential to enable flexible, general-purpose and dexterous robotic systems. Despite their advancements, our empirical experiments reveal that existing robot policies are prone to learning spurious correlations from pre-training trajectories, adversely affecting their generalization capabilities during inference. To tackle this, we propose a novel Policy Contrastive Decoding (PCD) approach, which redirects the robot policy’s focus toward object-relevant visual clues by contrasting action probability distributions derived from original and object-masked visual inputs. As a training-free method, our PCD can be used as a plugin to improve different types of robot policies without needing to finetune or access model weights. We conduct extensive experiments on top of three open-source robot policies, including the autoregressive policy OpenVLA and the diffusion-based policies Octo and Pi-0. The obtained results in both simulation and real-world environments prove PCD’s flexibility and effectiveness, e.g., PCD enhances the state-of-the-art policy Pi-0 by 8% in the simulation environment and by 108% in the real-world environment.
